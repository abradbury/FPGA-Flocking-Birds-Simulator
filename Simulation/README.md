Boid Simulator
==============

This simulator was created to demonstrate why load balancing is needed.

If the locations are static, then over the course of the simulation the boids will flock together and as they move around the locations will either have a lot of workload or very little.

Note that this simulation requires matplotlib to display the graphical output. If using Mac OS X and pip, one can use the following command to install this: sudo pip install numpy python-dateutil pytz pyparsing six --force-reinstall --upgrade
