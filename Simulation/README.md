Boid Simulator
==============

This simulator was created to demonstrate why load balancing is needed and determine the most effective load balancing technique to be used in the hardware implemenations.

If the BoidCPU edges are static, then over the course of the simulation the boids will flock together and as they move around the simulation area the BoidCPUs will either have a lot of workload or very little.

Note that the simulator requires matplotlib to display the graphical output. If using Mac OS X and pip, one can use the following command to install this: `sudo pip install numpy python-dateutil pytz pyparsing six --force-reinstall --upgrade`
